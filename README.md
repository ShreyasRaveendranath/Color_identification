# Color_identification
Color-Based Image Clustering and Matching

This Python code allows you to perform color-based clustering of images and match images based on a specified color. It extracts the dominant colors from the images using the K-means clustering algorithm and compares them with the provided color to select matching images.

Prerequisites:
To run this code, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

 Usage:
- Place the images you want to process in the "images" directory.
- Modify the code to adjust the desired parameters, such as the number of colors to extract and the color to match.
- Run the Python script using the following command:
